# AntiMailWall

The Infosec-industry is full of companies and vendors hiding brochures, manuals, whitepapers and other documents behind what I refer to as "Mailwall". Similar to Paywalls they require you to pay for access, except it's with your mail address (which will almost always be subsequently spammed with various marketing and advertising material) instead of money.

This practice is not just annoying, easy to circumvent and plain stupid, it's also humiliating in a sense. It's a concious effort by companies to decide what's best for me (namely their product or at the very least spam-ish information about it) instead of allowing me to make an informed decision with out any artificial barriers to information.

The repository contains all the documents I found behind Mailwalls and will be updated whenever I stumble across another one. I am not making a conscious effort to systematically or even programmaticaly collect documents, but I am taking pull requests if you have any additions.

My intention is not to avoid paying for access in a fiscal sense or to otherwise pirate copyrighted material. If you are the legitimate copyright holder and want me to remove one of your documents from this repository please contact me at [gmmi@gmmi.me](mailto:gmmi@gmmi.me).
